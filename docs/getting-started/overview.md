## What is Refine?

**Refine** is a React meta-framework for CRUD-heavy web applications. It addresses a wide range of enterprise use cases including internal tools, admin panels, dashboards and B2B apps.

Refine's core hooks and components streamline the development process by offering industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of a project, including **authentication**, **access control**, **routing**, **networking**, **state management**, and **i18n**.

Refine's headless architecture enables the building of highly customizable applications by decoupling business logic from UI and routing. This allows integration with:

- Any custom designs or UI frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), along with built-in support for [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

- Various platforms, including Next.js, Remix, React Native, Electron, etc., by a simple routing interface without the need for additional setup steps.

## Why Refine?

Within the broad spectrum of development approaches, Refine occupies a unique sweet spot between ‚Äústarting from scratch‚Äù with traditional development method and low-code/no-code solutions. With their respective initial pros at the beginning of development, both of the two extreme approaches may present long-term risks:

Despite offering the ultimate level flexibility, ‚ÄúStarting from scratch‚Äù method is likely to cause

- Project delays
- Technical debt
- Maintenance problems
- Lack of development and security best practices
- A polluted codebase
- And lack of standardization across teams

Low/no-code solutions address this shortcoming but create a new set of challenges such as

- Vendor lock-in
- Lack of customization & styling options
- Poor developer experience
- And limited support for complex use-cases

Offering the best from both worlds, Refine mitigates all risks of ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù development without compromising from flexibility, agility and open technologies.

## Use cases

**Refine** shines when it comes to _data-intensive_ applications like _admin panels_, _dashboards_ and _internal tools_.
